# Predicting Football Match outcomes with ML
Using a multi-layer perceptrom algorithm trained with backproagation. Model used is from the `scikit-learn` Python library. The model predicts results based on bookmakers odds.

I have also written a simple program at the bottom that simulates if one was betting Â£10 on the result that the algortihm predicts (only win, draw or loss). However the algorithm appears to be far too successful to be programmed correctly.
